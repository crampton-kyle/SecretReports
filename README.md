## Install Vue

### Install Node.js
We use the npm package manager to install vue and its dependencies. Since npm comes with Node.js, we need to install that.
1. Check if you have Node and npm installed with the following commands: 
  * `node --version`
  * `npm --version`
2. Install Node.js (which again, will come with npm).
  * If you have homebrew, you can do this with the following commands
    1. `brew update`
    2. `brew doctor`
    3. `brew install node`
  * If not, download from the web https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
  
### Install Vue
Install Vue with the following comand (using npm): `npm install -g @vue/cli`

Congrats! You have installed Vue!
